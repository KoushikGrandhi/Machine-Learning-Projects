Majorly contains object traking implementations using OpenCV with different approaches, so far implemented object tracking 
by captureing the object pixel intesity histogram.
Next up would be implementing using DNN: Pretrained pose_iter_102000 (working well on image, need to work on video) and using MeadiaPipe.
Might develop a Transformer network for the same
